you have local repository with multiple branches

you have a remote repository with multiple branches (online on github)

you work locally, and push to cloud to keep backups (verions)


branches are near-copies of the same repository 

a development branch contains your ongoing work. It might be untested or broken, or be exploring features you aren't sure about yet

the main branch only has completed, tested code that you know won't break


when you want to make a new branch to test out some new stuff or build something new,

use terminal command "git checkout -b name-of-branch"

this creates a copy of the branch you're on and gives it a new name. All changes are saved to the new branch though 

if you want to go back to the original branch, enter terminal command 
  "git checkout name-of-original"

However, you need to be careful about commits. 

Commit your changes before leaving a branch. Uncommitted changes follow you back into any new branch. They only become a permanent staple of a project codebase after being committed 
 
to commit a change, first add it to git tracking with  
 
"git add filename" 

then commit the changes with  

"git commit -m "commit message explaining what you did""

For example, dont write a bunch of code in the development branch, forget to commit something, and then switch back to master. You might end up committing something you didn't want to 


When you're happy with the state of the development branch you can merge it back into the main branch

first, make sure you have a remote copy of the development branch remotely before merging back in. When your changes are commmitted, use:

"git push" -- this will send everything up to github

Next switch to the main or master branch (whatever it's called)

"git checkout main" 

now pull from the remote repository to make sure all changes are up to date in the view of that branch

"git pull"

Now merge the development branch into main    

"git merge development" 

DONE  

Now, checkout a new branch for your next development effort    

"git checkout -b new-feature"
